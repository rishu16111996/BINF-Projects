This is my Machine Learning Project for Data acquisition in which we gather data from the web source, which is called “UCI Machine
learning repository”. This data set is present on this website as “Gene expression cancer RNA-Seq Data
Set”. Which is basically gene expression values from RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set. It is a random
extraction of gene expression of patients having different type of tumor : BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and
PRAD. This data set is good for classification models. It include 20531 genes in coloumns and 801 patients
in rows. I will try to predict the type of cancer tumor from above classes based on gene expression values.
