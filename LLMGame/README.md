# LLMGame  
*A fun and engaging game built around Language Models (LLMs)*

## 🎮 Project Overview  
LLMGame is an interactive application leveraging modern LLMs to create a game experience where players:
- Solve puzzles generated by an LLM  
- Engage in conversations or challenges driven by AI  
- Explore creative prompts and decision trees  
- Play through dynamically generated story nodes  
- Navigate endings based on their choices  

## 🧠 Key Features  
- AI‑driven story generation and branching  
- Structured game logic powered by Pydantic models  
- Player decision-making with multiple paths  
- Backend API built using FastAPI  
- Future‑ready system for adding more storylines or difficulty levels  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
- **Frontend:** (Add if applicable — React / Streamlit / HTML UI)  
- **AI/LLM Integration:** OpenAI / custom LLM backend  
- **Auth:** (Optional) JWT, session-based  
- **Deployment:** Docker / local development
